            Sessions are designed to help you achieve the outcomes you desire from
            counselling. I offer a safe, non-judgmental and confidential space
            where we can work at a pace comfortable for you. This may involve
            delving into current and past issues and unravelling the complexities of

            to do this and always work at the pace the client feels most
            comfortable with. I have a strong drive to help clients work
            towards self-understanding, self-compassion and empowerment.
