                I was very thankful to my therapist, Hillary. I felt her openness and
                non-judgemental stance allowed me to be vulnerable and explore emotions
                that would have been very difficult to access independently. I felt I was
                able to connect with my mum more deeply following the sessions and they
                were of such great help.

                I would wholeheartedly recommend Hillary. She provided a safe environment
                to share, and helped guide me to set specific goals to lead me to action.
                I have been surprised at the amount of change I have seen in myself in a
                relatively short time and have been left with tools I can use for life.

                Hillary's coaching was incredibly helpful. I very quickly felt safe and so
                was able to open up and really explore challenges I was facing. She was
                brilliant at helping me to see situations clearly and work towards solutions
                that felt right to me.
