          No matter what has led you to consider counselling, I'm here to work with you to

            <p>I was very thankful to my therapist, Hillary. I felt her openness and non-judgemental stance
              allowed me to be vulnerable and explore emotions that would have been very difficult to
              access independently. I felt I was able to connect with my mum more deeply following the
              sessions and they were of such great help

            <p>I would wholeheartedly recommend Hillary. She provided a safe environment to share, and helped
              guide me to set specific goals to lead me to action. I have been surprised at the amount of
              change I have seen in myself in a relatively short time and have been left with tools I can
              use for life.

            <p>Hillary's coaching was incredibly helpful. I very quickly felt safe and so was able to open
              up and really explore challenges I was facing. She was brilliant at helping me to see situations
              clearly and work towards solutions that felt right to me.

        <p class="lead mb-4">Our sessions are designed to help you achieve the outcomes you desire from
          counselling. I offer a safe, non-judgmental and confidential space where we can
          work at a pace comfortable for you. This may involve delving into current and past
          issues and unravelling the complexities of your present relationships and
          experiences.

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I have experience working with anxiety and low mood/depression. My speciality is
          being able to sit with clients in the emotional pain they are experiencing and be
          alongside them whilst making sense of it together. I draw upon a range of
          techniques and methods to do this and always work at the pace the client feels
          most comfortable with. I have a strong drive to help clients work towards self-
          understanding, self-compassion and empowerment.

            I am very aware of rising costs and short-term contracts as well as increased
            complexity of work have on mental health and motivation. I am keen to work with
            third sector organisations by offering tailored support for their staff during these

            As a qualified Counsellor and Coach, my approach involves working on a one-to-one basis

          It can feel scary deciding that you'd like to speak to a counsellor. Whether you're
