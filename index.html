        <p class="lead mb-4">Our sessions are designed to help you achieve the outcomes you desire from
          counselling. I offer a safe, non-judgmental and confidential space where we can
          work at a pace comfortable for you. This may involve delving into current and past
          issues and unravelling the complexities of your present relationships and
          experiences.

          I have experience working with anxiety and low mood/depression, My speciality is
          being able to sit with clients in the emotional pain they are experiencing and be
          alongside them whilst making sense of it together. I draw upon a range of
          techniques and methods to do this and always work at the pace the client feels
          most comfortable with. I have a strong drive to help clients work towards self-
          understanding, self-compassion and empowerment.

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I have worked in the third sector or Voluntary and Communities sector for 20
            years. During this time I have developed community projects, volunteered,

            I am very aware of rising costs and short-term contracts as well as increased

            As a qualified Counsellor and Coach, my approach involves working on a one-to-
            one basis with individuals who require support. I focus on the individual and their
            experience, taking into account the unique interplay between work and home life.
            My approach is friendly, supportive and collaborative. By integrating Counselling
            and Coaching I work in both a person-centred and solution-focused way to help
            the client work through issues such as:
          </p>
          Bereavement
          Stress

          It can feel scary deciding that you'd like to speak to a counsellor. Whether you're
          looking for someone to off-load to or longer-term therapy, I can help.
